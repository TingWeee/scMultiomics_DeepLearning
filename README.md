# scMultiomics_DeepLearning
Integrative analysis using autoencoders
The emergence of single-cell multimodal omics enabled multiple molecular programs to be simultaneously measured in individual cells at unprecedented resolution. However, analysis of sc-multimodal omics data is challenging due to lack of methods (?) that can accurately integrate across multiple data modalities. Here, we present Deep-omics, an approach for integrative analysis using Autoencoders. 

## Sample Datasets
### GSE128639 
Human bone marrow mononuclear cells - CITE-seq (Stuart et al., 2019)
### GSE100866
### GSE153056
### GSE164378
Human PBMC - Cite-seq, ECITE-seq (Hao et al., )
Dataset contains two batches and cells in both batches were annotated to 31 cell types. Batch 1 contains 67k cells (11k RNA, 228 ADT) and batch 2 contains 94k cells (12k RNA, 228 ADT) 
### GSE166489
(Ramaswamy et al., 
### E-MTAB-10026 
PBMC CITE-seq dataset (Stephenson et al., ) from healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients. 
### Human PBMC-CITE-seq (Kotliarov et., 2020) 
CITE-seq profiling of 82 surface proteins and transcriptomes of 53,201 single cells from healthy high and low influenza-vaccination responders.
